What if you could analyze your data… just by speaking to it?

I recently built a Voice-Powered AI SQL Analyst — an AI agent system that lets you ask a question with your voice and instantly receive insights from your database.

No typing.
No SQL.
No dashboards.
Just natural conversation.

🤖 What it does

Using a set of specialized AI agents, the system can:

🎤 Listen to your voice
🧠 Turn speech into text
📑 Generate SQL automatically with an LLM
🗂 Query a real database
📊 Summarize the results
🔊 Speak the answer back using natural AI voice

All in a single pipeline.

🧩 Why this matters

Not everyone knows SQL — but everyone has questions about their data.

This project shows how AI agents + data science can remove technical barriers and make insights accessible to anyone, regardless of skill level.

With voice interfaces and LLM reasoning:

Data becomes more interactive

Insights become more immediate

Analytics becomes more inclusive

Decision-making becomes more natural

This is where human–data interaction is heading.

🛠 Tech behind it

Groq LLM for fast text → SQL generation

SpeechRecognition / Whisper for STT

ElevenLabs for human-like TTS

Streamlit for a clean conversational UI

SQLite for structured trading data

Modular agents:

SpeechAgent

LLMAgent

TradingAgent

VoiceAgent

Each agent handles a separate responsibility — together they create a fluid, real-time data assistant.

🚀 The vision

Imagine analysts, traders, managers, students — anyone — simply asking:

“What’s my most profitable segment this month?”
“Show me the top trading pair this week.”
“What’s the total revenue last quarter?”

…and getting answers instantly.

This is what AI-powered data access can unlock.

If you want to explore the architecture or try it yourself, I’m happy to share the code or discuss the build! 🚀
